# ConvertPC2PE
Simple name pattern renamer to convert Minecraft Java Resource Pack to Pocket Edition/Bedrock Edition
Reason behind making this thing is because how ridiculous the marketplace is, I always like the idea of having the freedom to modify a existing resource pack and Bedrock Edition kills the freedom by introducing marketplace.
Ofcourse I do love to support the creator by donating them, but the microtransaction on the Bedrock Edition has been pushed to its absolute limit and so I decided to make this, it may never gonna finished or never gonna be perfect but atleast i tried to bring what Java offer to the Bedrock Community

Currently only rename Blocks,

Some blocks have a unique texture that really different from Pocket Edition/Bedrock Edition...
Known unique texture:
* Leaves - Different way of making the game show its colors.
* Grass (Normal, Path, and Snow) - Same as Leaves.
* Conduit (?)
* Command Blocks - PE have extra texture called _mipmap.png maybe for inventory.
